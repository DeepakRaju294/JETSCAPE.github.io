      <h2>Collaborate with JETSCAPE</h2>
      <div>
        <p class="standardFont">
          Members of the community are welcome to participate in the activities 
          of JETSCAPE as Associate Members of the Collaboration. Anyone who 
          works with or on the JETSCAPE Framework may become an Associate. 
          Associate Membership is obtained by contacting the JETSCAPE 
          Spokesperson. A letter conveying the intention to collaborate on 
          official letterhead is required (student and postdoctoral 
          collaborators will need a letter from their supervisor). Depending 
          on the amount of contributed effort, associate members may become 
          eligible to give invited JETSCAPE talks on research they have 
          contributed to, and may qualify as co-authors on the corresponding 
          JETSCAPE publications.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Membership</h2>
      <div>
        <p class="standardFont">
          Associate Members are also welcome to apply for full membership in the 
          JETSCAPE Collaboration. Membership in the Collaboration is contingent 
          upon the receipt of NSF funding directed towards JETSCAPE activities 
          (beyond REU supplements). Applicants for collaboration membership 
          should develop a Membership Proposal that expands the current scope of 
          JETSCAPE activities. If this Proposal is approved by the JETSCAPE 
          Council, the JETSCAPE Spokesperson (or designated representative) will 
          work with the applicant to develop a supplemental funding proposal to 
          the NSF.
