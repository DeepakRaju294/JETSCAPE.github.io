        <p class="standardFont">
          Microseconds after the Big Bang, the universe was filled with an 
          extremely hot fluid called the Quark-Gluon Plasma. As the universe 
          expanded, this plasma cooled and condensed into the building blocks 
          of ordinary matter around us: protons, neutrons, and atomic nuclei. 
          Droplets of this fluid, which exists only at temperatures above 2 
          trillion Kelvin, are generated and studied in the laboratory today 
          using collisions of high-energy heavy ions, at Brookhaven National 
          Laboratory and CERN. A key method to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma 
          is the generation of high-energy quarks and gluons in the collision,
          which interact with the hot plasma and emerge as “jets” of particles 
          that are measured by experiments. These jets provide powerful tools 
          to study the internal structure of the plasma, analogous to 
          tomography in medical imaging. However, interpretation of jet 
          measurements requires sophisticated numerical modeling and 
          simulation, and comparison of theory calculations with experimental 
          data demands advanced statistical tools. The JETSCAPE Collaboration, 
          an interdisciplinary team of physicists, computer scientists, and 
          statisticians, will develop a comprehensive software framework that 
          will provide a systematic, rigorous approach to meet this challenge. 
          Training programs, workshops, summer schools and MOOCs, will 
          disseminate the expertise needed to modify and maintain this framework.

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <div>
        <p class="standardFont">
          The JETSCAPE Collaboration will develop a scalable and portable open 
          source software package to replace a variety of existing codes. The 
          modular integrated software framework will consist of interacting 
          generators to simulate (i) wave functions of the incoming nuclei, 
          (ii) viscous fluid dynamical evolution of the hot plasma, and (iii) 
          transport and modification of jets in the plasma. Integrated advanced 
          statistical analysis tools will provide non-expert users with 
          quantitative methods to validate novel theoretical descriptions of 
          jet modification, by comparison with the complete set of current 
          experimental data. To improve the efficiency of this computationally 
          intensive task, the collaboration will develop trainable emulators 
          that can accurately predict experimental observables by interpolation 
          between full model runs, and employ accelerators such as Graphics 
          Processing Units (GPUs) for both the fluid dynamical simulations and 
          the modification of jets. The collaboration will create this framework 
          with a user-friendly envelope that allows for continuous modifications, 
          updates and improvements of each of its components. The effort will 
          serve as a template for other fields that involve complex dynamical 
          modeling and comparison with large data sets. It will open a new era 
          for high-precision extraction of the internal structure of the 
          Quark-Gluon Plasma with quantifiable uncertainties.
