Simulations of the full three-dimensional dissipative dynamics of the quark–gluon plasma with fluctuating initial conditions are computationally expensive and typically require some degree of parallelization. In this paper, we present a GPU implementation of the Kurganov–Tadmor algorithm which solves the 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1d relativistic viscous hydrodynamics equations including the effects of both bulk and shear viscosities. We demonstrate that the resulting CUDA-based GPU code is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding serial implementation of the Kurganov–Tadmor algorithm. We validate the code using (semi-)analytic tests such as the relativistic shock-tube and Gubser flow. \\nProgram summary \\nProgram Title: GPU-VH Program Files \"doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/dhnmtfpz9k.1\" Licensing Provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: CUDA C External routines/libraries: Google Test, GNU Scientific Library (GSL) Nature of problem: Dynamical evolution of the fluid dynamic stage of the quark-gluon plasma produced in nuclear collisions Solution method: Kurganov-Tadmor algorithm",

        "abstract": "In this work, the modification of hard jets in an extended static medium held at a fixed temperature is studied using three different Monte Carlo event generators: linear Boltzmann transport (LBT), modular all twist transverse-scattering elastic-drag and radiation (MATTER), and modular algorithm for relativistic treatment of heavy-ion interactions (MARTINI). Each event generator contains a different set of assumptions regarding the energy and virtuality of the partons within a jet versus the energy scale of the medium and, hence, applies to a different epoch in the space-time history of the jet evolution. Here modeling is developed where a jet may sequentially transition from one generator to the next, on a parton-by-parton level, providing a detailed simulation of the space-time evolution of medium modified jets over a much broader dynamic range than has been attempted previously in a single calculation. Comparisons are carried out for different observables sensitive to jet quenching, including the parton fragmentation function and the azimuthal distribution of jet energy around the jet axis. The effect of varying the boundary between different generators is studied and a theoretically motivated criterion for the location of this boundary is proposed. Lastly, the importance of such an approach with coupled generators to the modeling of jet quenching is discussed.",
